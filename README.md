# DeepLearning_withPyTorch-ObjectLocalization
Object localization using deep learning with PyTorch, implementing bounding box prediction on image data.


üéØ Object Localization with PyTorch

This project demonstrates object localization using deep learning in PyTorch. The model learns not just to classify objects in an image, but also to predict bounding box coordinates, effectively teaching the network "where" the object is.

üß† Objective

To build a PyTorch-based deep learning model capable of:

Identifying the object class (e.g., car, cat, ball)

Predicting the location of the object in the image via bounding box coordinates (x, y, width, height)

üìÇ Dataset

Used a custom or small-scale object localization dataset

Each sample contains:

The image

The bounding box coordinates

The object label/class

You can modify the dataset loader to use Pascal VOC or COCO datasets for larger-scale experiments.

üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

1. Data Preparation
Parsed image files and annotations

Applied transformations (resize, normalization)

Converted images and labels to PyTorch tensors

2. Model Architecture
CNN-based backbone (e.g., modified ResNet/CNN)

Regression head for bounding box coordinates

Classification head for object type

3. Loss Functions
Smooth L1 Loss or MSE for bounding box prediction

CrossEntropyLoss for classification

4. Training & Evaluation
Used optimizer: Adam or SGD

Plotted loss curves

Visualized predicted bounding boxes vs ground truth

üìà Results
Model was able to localize and classify objects in test images


üß™ Evaluation Metrics

IoU (Intersection over Union)

MSE for bounding box prediction

Classification accuracy

üí° Future Work

Extend to multi-object detection

Integrate with Faster R-CNN or YOLO

Add support for real-time webcam inference

üíª Technologies Used
